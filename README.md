# word_ladder_game
-  A word ladder is a word game invented by Lewis Carroll in which players find paths between words by switching one letter at a time.<br>
-  For example, one can link "ape" and "man" in the following way<br>
   >__ape__->apt->ait->bit->big->bag->mag->__man__<br>
-  Note that each step involves changing just one letter of the word.<br>
-  This is just one possible path from "ape" to "man", but is it the shortest possible path?<br>
-  If we desire to find the shortest word ladder path between two given words, the sparse graph submodule can help.<br>
